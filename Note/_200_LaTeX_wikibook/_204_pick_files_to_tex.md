    ```bash
    # Stick to lower-case letters without accents (a-z), the digits 0-9, the hyphen (−), and
    # only one full point or period (.) to separate the file extension (somewhat similar to the
    # conventions for a good Web URL): it will let you refer to TeX files over the Web more easily
    # and make your files more portable. Some operating systems do not distinguish between
    # upper-case and lower-case letters, others do. Therefore it’s best not to mix them.
    ```
