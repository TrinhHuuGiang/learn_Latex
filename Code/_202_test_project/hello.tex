% hello.tex

% A document split 2 part: 
%   + preamble (include package, declare setup for whole document)
%   + document: main document wrap in \begin{document} and \end{document}
%   * ignore: all content after document part will ignore


% After setup PATH to TeXLive run: 

%  Type 1: compile step by step ( other complex document include .bib and more steps needed to get the last PDF)
%   mkdir -p ./build && \    # && continue execute next command if program return 0(ok) else ignore after &&
%   pdflatex -output-directory="./build" hello.tex
%   

%  Type 2: automatic compile
%   mkdir -p ./build && \
%   latexmk --pdf -output-directory="./build" -jobname="OUTPUT_file_PDF"  main_file.tex

% This line is a command and tells LaTeX to use the
% article document class. A document class file defines
% the formatting, which in this case is a generic article
% format
\documentclass{article}


% This line is the beginning of the environment called
% document; it alerts LaTeX that content of the doc-
% ument is about to commence. Anything above this
% command is known generally to belong in the pream-
% ble.
\begin{document}


% This was the only actual line containing real content -
% the text that we wanted displayed on the page.
hello world!

% The document environment ends here. It tells LaTeX
% that the document source is complete, anything after
% this line will be ignored.
\end{document}
